  1- i see sometime my users use out of them limitation and i have some users with larg mount of trafics so i can not reset them trafics and i must add the last usage of users this couse complexity for me and i lost the real usage of them for every month 
  2- some users are traficless they can not use all them limitation so becouse of that they use them keys more than one month and thats make for me trouble becouse i have a limitation from my isp for  trafic and time
